# Readme for question 2

### Details of code:

* The 3 files (masses.npy, velocities.npy and positions.npy) should be in the same folder as the code
* The output of the code is the number of iterations it took to complete the task, and the execution time.
* For the code with tensorflow, the graph log is also written, which can be seen in tensorboard
* The output vectors(positions and velocities) of the two codes (q2-normal.py and q2-tf.py) will also be made in the same folder

### Modules use:
1. Numpy
2. Tensorflow
3. Time
4. Math

### Version of programming language:
Python2.7 with Conda 4.5.12
